Using Pauls 3D things open smartwatch as a base, dfplayer mini for the sound, a lot of 3D printed parts and Eva Foam for the wrist.

Contacts used for the bezel and the "Open/Close" detection
The contacts are soldered to the pins of buttons 2 and 3 on the pcb.
The bezel contains 8 1.5x6mm steel bolts which connect the contacts. For open/close the contact is a soldered shortcut so if the upper side with the spring loaded contacts touches it, the button is triggered.

4 x 10x 3mm Neodym Magnets glued on the round elevations and opposing site - liked it more than springs. If I would start new, I'd try a design it with 6 magnets.

1 Crayola Green - I melted it and used it to fill the pattern underneath the bezel.

1 small nail, cut to connect the inside to the trigger.

EVA Foam

1mm white - glue and roll

## Assembling
When assembling, keep the wires in the main body as short as possible as there is not much space to hide it afterwards.
For the cables which go outside (Power and Speaker) of the main body. use as thin as possible and flexible cables. otherwise it will have an effect on the pop up mechanism. 
I drilled a hole in the bottom cover to get the cables out. Also used some Hotglue to fix the necessary length for the movement inside the case.
Make sure to use some grease on the latch (Where it moves and on top) This makes opening and closing MUCH smoother. Depending on our print, you also have to sand a bit on the mechanism which holds the pop up part in order to make it smoother.

I used ASA for all the 3D printed parts.
