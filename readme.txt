Using Pauls 3D things open smartwatch as a base, dfplayer mini for the sound, a lot of 3D printed parts and Eva Foam for the wrist.

Warning - this project is as far away from print in place as it gets. When it comes to the electronics, you should know what you do. No warranty from my side.

Contacts used for the bezel and the "Open/Close" detection
The contacts are soldered to the pins of buttons 2 and 3 on the pcb.
The bezel contains 8 1.5x6mm steel bolts which connect the contacts. For open/close the contact is a soldered shortcut so if the upper side with the spring loaded contacts touches it, the button is triggered.
